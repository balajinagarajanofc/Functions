# Functions

**Functions** are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure â€” a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### There are 4 types of `Functions`

1. Named Function
2. Anonymous Function
3. Arrow Function
4. IIFE Function
